SQL Database Helper

The program has been updated and now features a GUI. The program is still a work in progress, although the same functionality will exist as I update it.

Right now all you have to do is clone the project, and connect to a database, and you will see a Create Table panel on the right side, and an add column feature below it. On the left side you will see a list of tables which you can select and then display the content.

One thing that is  needed is a jdbc driver specific to the Database you use in order to form a connection. Just add a driver to the build path.
